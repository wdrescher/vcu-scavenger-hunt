Blind testing feedback

Good:
    -Home page looks modern
    -Slideshow images are recognizeable
    -Obvious how to start the hunt 
    -Nice to see map

Bad:
    -Top bar looks plain(Nav bar)
    -Bottom bar doesn't line up right(Footer)
    -Landmark list looks plain(No styling from Willem yet)
    -Landmark Detail page looks a plain
    -Altria question was confusing
        -Why is it relevant
        -Should mention that its French
    -When question is answered correctly, the black overlay doesn't disappear
    -Should be able to click quiz word to select answer(as opposed to only the radio button)
    -After question is successfully completed, should be redirected to list of landmarks
    -Map makes it easy to see where to go, maybe should be hidden by default
    -About page styling looks weird(image repeats, sentence placement doesn't look right)
    -My Profile page seems unnecessary or unfinished

Comments:
    -Most feedback is that the aesthetic is lacking.  Maybe focus on a color scheme
